# yamlreel

**Write a short YAML file. Get a finished video.**

<sub>Created by <a href="https://github.com/nsijwali">Nitin Sijwali</a></sub>

yamlreel turns a YAML file into a finished video: system-design explainers, code tips, project launches and
feature demos for YouTube, Shorts and LinkedIn, with diagrams, typed code, original music and an optional
voiceover in your own voice.

## What you get

Every render writes this layout (the output folder is `yamlreel-output/` unless you pass `--out DIR`):

```
yamlreel-output/
├── vertical/            one folder per format: landscape 1920×1080, vertical 1080×1920, square 1080×1080
│   ├── video.mp4        H.264 (+ AAC when there is music or a voice). Frame 0 is the poster, so the thumbnail is never blank.
│   ├── poster.jpg       the settled hook frame, ready to upload as a thumbnail
│   └── contact.png      two labelled stills per scene: look at this before you publish
└── share-copy.txt       title, description and hashtags for the whole video, ready to paste
```

`share-copy.txt` adds `#Shorts` for vertical clips up to 60 seconds. Videos can be any length, and only a
vertical video over 3 minutes gets a warning. Music is generated on your machine (plucked strings in a
Japanese scale), so there is nothing to license or credit.

## Quick start

You need **Python 3.10 or newer**. pip installs everything else except fonts on macOS and Windows (see the note below).

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install "yamlreel[ffmpeg]"
```

Prefer an isolated command-line install? `pipx install "yamlreel[ffmpeg]"` works too.

Make your first video:

```bash
yamlreel init system-design my-video.yaml     # a starter spec (or: project, code-tip)
yamlreel render my-video.yaml --preview       # half size, 12 fps: check layout and timing in seconds
yamlreel render my-video.yaml                 # full quality, every format in the spec
```

Open `yamlreel-output/<format>/contact.png` first. To try the showcased example without setting up a voice:

```bash
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nsijwali/yamlreel/main/examples/cache-stampede-45s.yaml
yamlreel render cache-stampede-45s.yaml --no-voice
```

> **Fonts on macOS and Windows:** yamlreel draws text with the free DejaVu fonts, which most Linux systems
> include. On macOS run `brew install --cask font-dejavu` once. On Windows, install them from
> [dejavu-fonts.github.io](https://dejavu-fonts.github.io) ("Install for me" is fine).

<details>
<summary><b>Install details for each system</b></summary>

<br>

| | macOS | Linux | Windows (PowerShell) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Python 3.10+ | `brew install python@3.12` or [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) | usually installed; Debian/Ubuntu also need `python3-venv` | [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/), then use `py` instead of `python3` |
| Activate the venv | `source .venv/bin/activate` | same | `.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` (if scripts are blocked: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned`) |
| ffmpeg | the `[ffmpeg]` extra (or `brew install ffmpeg`) | the extra, or `sudo apt install ffmpeg`. On Fedora use the extra: its own `ffmpeg-free` cannot encode H.264 | the `[ffmpeg]` extra |
| Fonts | `brew install --cask font-dejavu` | Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install fonts-dejavu-core`; Fedora: `sudo dnf install dejavu-sans-fonts dejavu-serif-fonts dejavu-sans-mono-fonts`; Arch: `sudo pacman -S ttf-dejavu` | DejaVu from [dejavu-fonts.github.io](https://dejavu-fonts.github.io) |
| Web captures (optional) | `pip install "yamlreel[capture]"` then `playwright install chromium` | same | same |

- **ffmpeg:** yamlreel uses the `ffmpeg` on your PATH if there is one, and otherwise the copy that the `[ffmpeg]` extra (the `imageio-ffmpeg` package) brings along. You only need one of them.
- **Fonts:** yamlreel looks in your `font_dir` setting (or `YAMLREEL_FONT_DIR`) first, then the system font folders, then your own (`~/Library/Fonts` on macOS, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Fonts` on Windows). If your fonts live anywhere else, point `font_dir` at that folder. Japanese text uses Noto CJK when it is installed.
- **Web captures** are only needed for `shot` scenes that screenshot a URL. `chromium_path` in your user config (or `YAMLREEL_CHROMIUM`) picks a different browser.
- **Windows** is not covered by CI yet. Reports are welcome.

## Examples

| Spec | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| [`examples/cache-stampede-45s.yaml`](https://github.com/nsijwali/yamlreel/blob/main/examples/cache-stampede-45s.yaml) | A 45-second system-design explainer with a diagram, code and a narrated script. |

It is narrated; add `--no-voice` to render it with music only. For more starting points, run
`yamlreel init` with the `system-design`, `project` or `code-tip` template.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `yamlreel --version` | Prints the installed version and exits. |
| `yamlreel init <template> <file>` | Writes a starter spec: `system-design`, `project` or `code-tip`. |
| `yamlreel validate <spec>` | Checks a spec and prints its scene count and length, without rendering. |
| `yamlreel render <spec>` | Renders. Useful flags: `--preview`, `--out DIR`, `--format vertical\|landscape\|square\|all`, `--music koto\|none\|file.mp3`, `--fps N`, `--no-voice`, `--voice-url URL`, `--read-screen`, `--allow-path DIR`, `--allow-private-hosts`. |
| `yamlreel config init [--user]` / `config show` | Writes a starter config, or shows the merged settings and the files they came from. |
| `yamlreel music --seconds 30 --out track.wav` | Generates the music track on its own (`--bpm`, `--root`, `--scale`, `--seed`). |

## Writing a spec

A spec is a list of scenes. Each scene has a `type`, how many `seconds` it lasts, and an optional `caption`
(a lower third that fades in).

```yaml
meta: {title: "Cache stampede in 45 seconds", tags: [systemdesign, caching]}
theme: midnight                     # sumi | washi | midnight | your own
formats: [vertical, landscape]
scenes:
  - type: type
    text: What is a cache stampede?
    seconds: 3
  - type: bullets
    title: The fix
    items: [Let one request rebuild the key, Serve stale while it refreshes, Add jitter to every TTL]
  - type: stat
    value: "10,000 → 1"
    label: database queries per expiry
```

| Scene | Shows | Main fields |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `title` | eyebrow, title, subtitle and URL, easing in line by line | `title`, `eyebrow`, `subtitle`, `url` |
| `type` | one line typed out with a cursor: your hook | `text` |
| `bullets` | points that appear one at a time | `title`, `items` |
| `code` | code typed on screen, with highlighted lines | `code`, `highlight`, `title` |
| `stat` | one big number or phrase | `value`, `label`, `eyebrow` |
| `diagram` | boxes and arrows that appear in order, packets flowing, nodes flashing | `nodes`, `edges`, `flash`, `title` |
| `shot` | a screenshot of a URL or an image, with a slow camera move | `source`, `zoom`, `focus`, `fit`, `click`, `scroll_y` |

<details>
<summary><b>All spec options</b></summary>

<br>

```yaml
meta: {title, description, tags: [], links: [], credits: []}
theme: sumi | washi | midnight | <a theme from your config>
formats: [vertical, landscape, square]
music: {style: koto | none | path/to.mp3, bpm: 72, root: D, scale: hirajoshi, seed: 7, snap: false, volume: 0.9}
watermark: "Your Name"        # or {text|image: logo.png, position: top-left|top-right|bottom-left|bottom-right, opacity: 0.75, size: 30}
poster: {scene: 0, at: 2.6}   # optional; default is the first scene, just before it ends
voiceover: {voice, language, gap, music_level, read_screen}
scenes: [...]
```

- **Diagrams:** `nodes` take `id, label, kind (client|service|cache|db), x, y, at`, where `x` and `y` are fractions of the frame. `vx, vy` override them in vertical frames, so one diagram fits both shapes. `edges` take `from, to, label, bad, dashed, at, color` and `flash` takes `node, at, text, color`.
- **Shots:** `source` (URL or image), `fit: cover | card`, `zoom: [from, to]`, `focus: [x, y]`, `focus_to`, `click: [selectors]`, `scroll_y`, `wait_ms`, `viewport`, `scale`. Screenshots are cached in `<output folder>/.cache`; delete it to capture again.
- **Unknown keys are errors:** a misspelled or extra key stops the render, for example `error: scenes[0].titel: unknown field for a title scene; allowed: caption, eyebrow, narration, ...`, instead of being silently ignored.
- **Limits:** `limits.max_seconds` and `limits.max_scenes` are capped at 3600 and 1000, whatever a spec or config sets.
- **Files:** images, pages, music and logos must sit in the spec's folder, a config folder, or a folder you allow with `--allow-path DIR` (or `allow_paths` in your user config).
- **Music:** `seed` changes the melody and `snap: true` rounds scene lengths to beats. To use your own track, point `style` at an audio file and credit it in `meta.credits`.
- **Watermark:** appears on every frame and the poster. The default corner is bottom-right for landscape and top-left for vertical, because the Shorts buttons cover the right edge and the bottom.

</details>

**Tips**
- Text never silently overflows. It wraps, then shrinks, and `render` warns you when it had to.
- In vertical frames, content sits above the lower third, clear of the Shorts UI.
- A 15-second video carries one idea. Before you publish, check anything you simplified.

## Voiceover in your own voice

Give a scene a `narration:` line and yamlreel speaks it, lowers the music under the voice, and makes the scene as
long as the speech needs. Speech comes from a text-to-speech server **you choose**: one on your own machine, for example
[VoiceStudio](https://github.com/debpalash/VoiceStudio) (which can also clone your voice from a short recording), or a remote one.
Your narration text goes to that server, so it stays on your machine only if the server is local.

```yaml
scenes:
  - type: type
    text: What is a cache stampede?
    narration: Ever seen one expired cache key take down a whole database? That's a cache stampede.
  - type: title
    title: Cache stampede
    narration: false          # silent end card
```

> **Write narration, don't read the screen.** The voice sounds natural when it *explains* what the viewer sees,
> in a sentence or two. `read_screen: true` (or `--read-screen`) speaks every title, bullet and caption word
> for word, for scenes without their own `narration:`. That is fine as a quick draft, but it sounds robotic in a
> finished video. `--no-voice` renders any spec with music only.

<details>
<summary><b>Set up VoiceStudio, step by step</b></summary>

<br>

1. **Install and open VoiceStudio.** Use the [desktop app](https://github.com/debpalash/VoiceStudio/releases/latest)
   (easiest), or run it from source (`uv sync`, then `uv run uvicorn main:app --app-dir backend --port 3900`).
   Its speech server listens on `http://127.0.0.1:3900/mcp/` while it is running.
2. **Accept the model licences.** Open *Model Catalogue* and accept the terms for **OmniVoice** and its audio
   tokenizer. Until you do, every request fails with `403 Forbidden`. The first request also downloads the
   model (about 2.3 GB).
3. **(Optional) Clone your voice.** In *Voice cloning*, add a 5 to 10 second recording of yourself in a quiet
   room, with its exact transcript. Copy the voice's **profile id**.
4. **Tell yamlreel where the server is, once.** Run `yamlreel config init --user` and open
   `~/.config/yamlreel/config.yaml`. At the bottom, uncomment `voice_server:` and its `url:` line. Under the
   existing `voiceover:` block, uncomment `voice:` and paste your profile id there (leave it out to use the
   server's default voice). You can also pass `--voice-url http://127.0.0.1:3900/mcp/` on each render.

Prefer to record yourself? Use `narration_audio: clip.wav` (PCM WAV, inside the spec folder or an allowed
folder) instead of `narration:`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How voiceover works: other servers, privacy, caching</b></summary>

<br>

- **Any compatible server works.** yamlreel speaks MCP "Streamable HTTP" and calls the server's `generate_speech` tool, which must return the audio inline (VoiceStudio's default). VoiceStudio is just one server that does this.
- **Privacy:** narration text goes to the server you configured. A local server (such as VoiceStudio on `127.0.0.1`) keeps it on your machine; a remote URL sends it to that host. A spec cannot choose the server: the address comes only from your user config or the command line.
- **Precedence:** a scene's own `narration:` wins over `read_screen`, and `narration: false` keeps a scene silent.
- **Caching:** audio is cached in `<output folder>/.cache/narration-v2-*.wav`, keyed by the server address (scheme, host, port and path; never the `user:password@` part, query or fragment), the voice (or `client_id` when no voice is set), the language and the text, so re-renders do not speak lines again. The cache is never pruned. Clear it with `rm "<output folder>"/.cache/narration-*.wav`. Upgrading to 0.2.2 re-voices every line once. Changing the engine, model or account behind the **same** server URL, or the recording behind a voice, is not detected: run that `rm` afterwards.
- **Licences:** VoiceStudio is AGPL-3.0, and its models have their own licences, which its Model Catalogue shows per model. OmniVoice's weights are non-commercial (CC-BY-NC), and that may carry over to the speech they generate. Check before you monetise a video.

</details>

## Configuration

Defaults live in a config file, so a spec only needs to say what is different for that video. You can adapt
yamlreel to your own name, colours and music without touching code.

```bash
yamlreel config init            # ./yamlreel.config.yaml: this project (add it to your .gitignore)
yamlreel config init --user     # ~/.config/yamlreel/config.yaml: every project
yamlreel config show            # the merged settings, and the files they came from
```

Settings apply in this order, lowest to highest: **built-in defaults → user config → project config → the spec → command-line flags**.
Nested settings merge, so setting only `music.bpm` keeps the rest. `meta.tags`, `links` and `credits` add up across layers.

What you can set: `theme`, your own `themes` (colours, `extends`, `display: serif | sans`, `frame`), `formats`,
`fps`, `output_dir`, `watermark` (text or a logo), `music`, `voiceover`, `meta` defaults and `limits`. Your name,
watermark and default tags belong in config, not in code. Every option is explained in
[`yamlreel/templates/config.example.yaml`](https://github.com/nsijwali/yamlreel/blob/main/yamlreel/templates/config.example.yaml).

A few settings widen what a spec can touch, so yamlreel only reads them from your **user** config or the command
line, never from a spec or project config you downloaded: `allow_paths`, `allow_private_hosts`,
`chromium_path`, `font_dir` and `voice_server`. See [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/nsijwali/yamlreel/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

## Troubleshooting

| You see | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `ffmpeg not found` | `pip install "yamlreel[ffmpeg]"`, or install ffmpeg with your package manager. |
| `font 'DejaVuSans-Bold.ttf' not found` | Install DejaVu (see *Install details*), or point `font_dir` in your user config at the folder that holds them. |
| `scene 0 has narration but no voice server is configured` | Start VoiceStudio and set `voice_server` in your user config, pass `--voice-url`, or render with `--no-voice`. |
| `cannot reach the voice server … Is VoiceStudio running?` | Start VoiceStudio and check that the URL ends in `/mcp/`. |
| `Client error '403 Forbidden' for url '…/generate'` | Accept the OmniVoice and tokenizer licences in VoiceStudio's Model Catalogue. |
| `Server error '500'` from the voice server, or the server is killed | The machine is out of memory. Close other apps, and use a 5 to 10 second voice sample: a longer reference needs over 2 GB on the CPU. |
| `voice server reply had no audio` | VoiceStudio is set to `OMNIVOICE_MCP_OUTPUT_MODE=files`. yamlreel needs the default inline mode. |
| `capturing a URL needs playwright` | `pip install "yamlreel[capture]"`, then `playwright install chromium`. |
| `could not capture … Executable doesn't exist` | Run `playwright install chromium`, or set `chromium_path` in your user config. |
| `… outside the folders this run may read` | Move the file next to your spec, or pass `--allow-path DIR`. For localhost pages, add `--allow-private-hosts`. |
| A narration line still uses an old voice | The cache cannot see a change behind the same server URL (new engine, model, account or voice recording). Run `rm "<output folder>"/.cache/narration-*.wav`. |
| Homebrew fails to build ffmpeg or Python | Older macOS versions get no prebuilt packages. Use the `[ffmpeg]` extra for ffmpeg, and [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or `uv` for Python. |

## Built with

| | Used for |
| --- | --- |
| [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org), [NumPy](https://numpy.org), [PyYAML](https://pyyaml.org) | drawing every frame, generating the music, reading specs |
| [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) (or [imageio-ffmpeg](https://github.com/imageio/imageio-ffmpeg)) | encoding the video |
| [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/) | capturing web pages for `shot` scenes (optional) |
| [DejaVu fonts](https://dejavu-fonts.github.io) | all on-screen text |
| [VoiceStudio](https://github.com/debpalash/VoiceStudio) with [OmniVoice](https://huggingface.co/k2-fsa/OmniVoice) | the optional local voiceover, including voice cloning (not bundled) |
| [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) | building, testing and reviewing yamlreel |

If you publish a video voiced with OmniVoice, credit it and keep it non-commercial: its licence (CC-BY-NC)
requires both, and VoiceStudio's audio tokenizer has its own terms (see *Licences* above). yamlreel puts a
spec's `meta.credits` into `share-copy.txt` for you.

## Why yamlreel

- **Manim** is excellent for math animation, but each animation is code you write. yamlreel is a spec: you describe scenes, not frames.
- **Remotion** renders video from React and is very flexible. yamlreel trades that flexibility for zero JavaScript and a fixed set of scene types.
- **MoviePy** edits and composes video clips you already have. yamlreel generates frames and music itself and adds an optional voiceover.
- **Online AI video tools** are quick but run in the cloud, usually cost money, and your script and voice leave your machine. yamlreel renders locally and is MIT licensed; your narration stays local only if your voice server is.

## Contributing

Bug reports, new scene types, examples and docs are welcome. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/nsijwali/yamlreel/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for setup and the pull request flow.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nsijwali/yamlreel.git
cd yamlreel
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e '.[dev,ffmpeg]'
pytest -q
```

Tests never read your own user or project config. Checks that need `ffprobe`, Playwright or Chromium are skipped
when those tools are missing. CI runs on Ubuntu with Python 3.10 and 3.12.

## Security and licence

Specs are treated as untrusted input. File access is confined, URL captures are checked, and settings that widen
access come only from you. [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/nsijwali/yamlreel/blob/main/SECURITY.md) covers the details and how to report a vulnerability.

yamlreel is [MIT licensed](https://github.com/nsijwali/yamlreel/blob/main/LICENSE). Tools you pair it with keep their own licences.
